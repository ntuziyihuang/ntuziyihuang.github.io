[{"content":"As part of improving my digital garden, I rebuilt my study notes website with a cleaner layout, better navigation and custom styling.\nKey aspects of the revamp include:\nMigrating content into a Hugo site using the PaperMod theme. Adding menus for notes, projects and tags to improve discoverability. Creating custom CSS to personalize colours, spacing and typography. Designing a hero section with an abstract graphic to welcome visitors. This project demonstrates how a static site generator like Hugo can be combined with thoughtful design to create a professional looking website.\n","permalink":"https://ntuziyihuang.github.io/projects/site-revamp/","summary":"A project focused on redesigning my study notes site using the Hugo framework and PaperMod theme.","title":"Study Notes Website Revamp"},{"content":"The difference between Strategic Planning and Strategic thinking Strategic planning is the process by which leaders define an organization’s direction and allocate resources to move it forward. It sets the framework — the goals, timelines, and initiatives — that guide collective action.\nStrategic thinking, on the other hand, is how individuals and teams translate those high-level goals into practical paths under real-world constraints. It involves understanding the organization’s long-term objectives and making creative, forward-looking decisions that account for the industry environment, customer needs, and competitive landscape.\nTo strengthen strategic thinking:\nChallenge assumptions. Question how things are done and give credit to unconventional or “wild” ideas that may reveal new opportunities. Stay alert to customer opportunities. Keep your eyes open for ways to serve customers better and align your actions with the organization’s overarching mission. Strategic thinking connects vision to action. When practiced consistently, it helps both individuals and organizations stay adaptable, focused, and on the path to sustainable success.\n","permalink":"https://ntuziyihuang.github.io/notes/the-difference-between-strategic-planning-and-strategic-thinking/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-difference-between-strategic-planning-and-strategic-thinking\"\u003eThe difference between Strategic Planning and Strategic thinking\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/notes/the-difference-between-strategic-planning-and-strategic-thinking/5-techniques-to-improve-strategic-thinking.jpg\"\u003e\nStrategic planning is the process by which leaders define an organization’s direction and allocate resources to move it forward.

It supports multiple programming paradigms and has a large standard library, making it suitable for everything from scripting and automation to web development and data science.\nVariables and Data Types Variables store values that your program can manipulate. Python is dynamically typed, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to explicitly declare a variable\u0026rsquo;s type. Common data types include int, float, str, bool, list and dict.\na = 42 # integer b = 3.14 # floating point c = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; # string d = True # boolean e = [1, 2, 3] # list f = {\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;: 10, \u0026#34;y\u0026#34;: 20} # dictionary print(a, b, c, d, e, f) Control Structures Python uses indentation to denote code blocks. Conditional statements and loops control the flow of your program.\nfor i in range(5): if i % 2 == 0: print(f\u0026#34;{i} is even\u0026#34;) else: print(f\u0026#34;{i} is odd\u0026#34;) Conclusion This note introduces Python\u0026rsquo;s core syntax and features.
