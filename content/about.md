## About This Site

This website serves as my personal hub for study notes, tutorials and projects.  
I am passionate about continual learning and enjoy documenting concepts in a way that makes them easy to reference and revisit later.  

The notes section contains articles organized by topic with clear tables of contents, descriptive summaries and syntax‑highlighted code blocks.  
In the projects section you’ll find examples of how I've applied these concepts in real‑world scenarios.  

Feel free to explore, share and provide feedback via the social links in the header.
