Strategic planning is the process by which leaders define an organization’s direction and allocate resources to move it forward. It sets the framework — the goals, timelines, and initiatives — that guide collective action.
	Strategic thinking, on the other hand, is how individuals and teams translate those high-level goals into practical paths under real-world constraints. It involves understanding the organization’s long-term objectives and making creative, forward-looking decisions that account for the industry environment, customer needs, and competitive landscape.
	To strengthen strategic thinking:
		1. **Challenge assumptions.** Question how things are done and give credit to unconventional or “wild” ideas that may reveal new opportunities.
		2. **Stay alert to customer opportunities.** Keep your eyes open for ways to serve customers better and align your actions with the organization’s overarching mission.
	Strategic thinking connects vision to action. When practiced consistently, it helps both individuals and organizations stay adaptable, focused, and on the path to sustainable success.
