As part of improving my digital garden, I rebuilt my study notes website with a cleaner layout, better navigation and custom styling.

Key aspects of the revamp include:

- Migrating content into a Hugo site using the PaperMod theme.
- Adding menus for notes, projects and tags to improve discoverability.
- Creating custom CSS to personalize colours, spacing and typography.
- Designing a hero section with an abstract graphic to welcome visitors.

This project demonstrates how a static site generator like Hugo can be combined with thoughtful design to create a professional looking website.
